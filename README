Curtis's RD PM bot

This is an old project that I used to learn NodeJS. It was implemented on ReignDesign (a company I had previously worked for)
servers. When I left ReignDesign I was allowed to take the code since it was written by me to help with my project management 
duties there.

Basically this is a project management tool that allows the user to enter in project information. That information is stored
in a MongoDB database and the system autmatically checks to see which tasks in various projects are upcoming or overdue
and sends automated messages to the teams working on those tasks via Slack.

This project relies on the Express, Bootstrap, Mongoose frameworks.

To test this locally create a file called `.env` in the root and set properties for example:

```
MONGODB_URI='mongodb://localhost:27017/rdshanghai'
PORT=4444
DEBUG_SLACK_CHANNEL='flummoxed'
```
